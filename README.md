## Bug / Issues:

I created this theme to suit my preferences in color. There are many languages and parts of VS Code that I don't use, so if something doesn't look right you can create an issue and/or make a pull request.

Alternatively, if you like the overall look of this theme but want to change a thing or two, you can use this reference to override the color in your **settings.json** file: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color
